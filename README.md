## Introduction  

In this project, I created two human resources dashboards - Overview and Employee Details. 

This project is created following Baraa Salkini's course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-tableau-ultimate-course-from-zero-to-hero). Dataset used in this course was generated by ChatGPT and Faker library.  

## Tools I Used
**Tableau:**
**draw.io:**
**Git & Github:** My go-to for version control and tracking my project progress.

# Steps to Build Dashboards
## :one: Define User -Requirements
## :two: Build Data Source
The data for this project was provided by the course. After connecting it to Tableau, I performed an initial inspection, verifying data quality and ensuring that data types were correctly assigned to each column. The dataset was clean, and Tableau accurately mapped the data types. During this stage, I also began exploring the dataset by adding it to the worksheet for further analysis.
## :three: Build Charts
At this stage, I analyzed user requirements and identified the most suitable chart types to effectively present each requirement. I also designed a template sheet that defined the background color, font style, and custom color palette to streamline the dashboard creation process. This preparation eliminated the need for repetitive settings when starting new worksheets for the project.  

Custom Settings:
- Colors: `#03c4a1`, `#c52a87`, `#777777` and `#f5f5f5`
- Font: Trebuchet MS
- Background color: Dark  

### Calculated Fields Created
I then created several calculated fields and tested to ensure all formulas are valid.

```
Employee Location:
CASE [State]
    WHEN 'New York' THEN 'HQ
    ELSE 'Branch'
END
```
```
Total Employee Terminated:
COUNT(
    IF NOT ISNULL([Termdate])
    THEN[Employee ID]
END)
```
```
Age:
DATEDIFF('year',[Birthdate],TODAY())
```
```
Employee Age Group:
IF [Age] < 25 THEN '<25'
ELSEIF [Age] >=25 AND [Age] < 35 THEN '25-35'
ELSEIF [Age] >=35 AND [Age] < 45 THEN '35-45'
ELSEIF [Age] >=45 AND [Age] < 55 THEN '45-55'
ELSEIF [Age] >=55 THEN '55+'
END
``` 
```
Highlight Max:
WINDOW_MAX([Total Hired]) = [Total Hired]
```
```
Hightlight Max Percentage:
WINDOW_MAX([% Total hired]) = [% Total hired] 
```
```
Highlight Top 2 Job Titles:
RANK([% Total Hired]) <= 2
```


### Charts Used

- BAN (Big Ass Numbers) + Line Chart: Presented number of active and terminated employees
- Bar Chart: Department
- Map: Location
- Pie Chart: Gender
- Heat Map: Show correlations between two dimentions, age group and education level.
- Barbell Chart: 
- SCatter Plot:
### Hierarchies Created
- Location:
- Department:


## :three: Dashboard Build
The first step at this stage was to sketch out the dashboard design briefly with draw.io . The summary view dashboard consists of three major components:  
- Navigation Bar: With logo and navigation icons
- Header: With header and filters
- Charts:  
  - Overview: Showed sum of employees, department infomration and location
  - Demographic: Revealed information on gender, education level, age and performance ratings
  - Income Analysis: Discovered correlation between education level, gender and salary

*Detail design for chart container* 
![Dashboard1_3](/Material/Images/Dashboard1_3.png)

With a sketch in hand, I created container structure and pulled in all elements. Then added in tooltips. I added in more calculated fields to enhance the presentation of the charts at this stage.
```
Rank Top 2 Job Counts:
RANK(
    [% Total Hired]) <= 2
)
```
```
Tenure:
IF ISNULL([Termdate])
THEN DATEDIFF ('year',[Hiredate],TODAY())
ELSE DATEDIFF ('year',[Hiredate],[Termdate])
END
```
